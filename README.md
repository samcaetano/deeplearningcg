# Deep Learning in Computer Graphics

I implemented this project as a seminar of my undergraduate discipline Computer Graphics (Computação Gráfica) at São Paulo State University.
This repo contains a seminar on Deep Learning (DL), covering essencial topics in DL with scripts. 

This is for public usage, but please email me so that I can know this is helping others! =)
